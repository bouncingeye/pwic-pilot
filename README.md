PWIC: Permanent Web Index Coalition

🌍 Global Index Integrity: Securing the Digital Record

The Permanent Web Index Coalition (PWIC) is an urgent, multi-national initiative dedicated to ensuring the resilience and long-term integrity of the world's core knowledge index. This project is framed not as a competitive search solution, but as an essential Critical Infrastructure Doctrine designed to mitigate systemic risks associated with single-point-of-failure indexing systems.

Recent failures highlight the vulnerability of the global digital record, where crucial data can become inaccessible overnight, risking multi-billion dollar economic impacts and compromising institutional memory.

The PWIC provides a decentralized, auditable, and academically grounded solution to this instability.

🎯 Mission

To pioneer an open-source, non-competitive, and distributed Permanent Web Index using advanced decentralized storage and Knowledge Graph technologies (Triple Store architecture). This index serves as a global, non-commercial lifeboat for information—a last resort that guarantees access to essential data, regardless of the operational status of commercial search providers.

🔑 Key Principles

Principle

Description

Resilience First

The primary goal is redundancy and fault tolerance against major infrastructure failures.

Non-Competitive

PWIC data is not optimized for consumer search relevance; it is optimized for preservation and fact retrieval (the "ground truth").

Academic & Institutional

Governance, maintenance, and query access are restricted to qualified academic, governmental, and non-profit institutions.

Auditability

Every index entry is cryptographically linked to its origin and modification history.

Status: Pilot Readiness

The PWIC has successfully defined its full architecture and is ready to enter the Pilot Deployment Phase in collaboration with initial partners.
