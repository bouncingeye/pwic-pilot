Public Web Index Cooperative (PWIC) - The Resilience Index

"If the lights go out, we have batteries. If the index goes out, we have nothing."
— Shannon Jefferson, PWIC Founder

The Public Web Index Cooperative (PWIC) is a neutral, non-commercial, and fully redundant digital public safety infrastructure designed to ensure continuous discoverability of critical public, academic, and scientific data, regardless of commercial index failures.

The PWIC is led by Shannon Jefferson, Executive Director (Volunteer).

1. The Critical Problem: Systemic Risk

The stability of global commerce, research, and governance is dependent on a single, private, proprietary search index. This represents a single point of failure that is both a geopolitical and economic disaster waiting to happen.

Economic Exposure: A 72-hour search index blackout is estimated to cost the US GDP $43 billion.

Data Fragility: Critical public data (scientific papers, .gov records, .edu research) is difficult to audit, verify, and track outside of major search engines.

Governance Failure: There is currently ZERO redundancy for essential public digital infrastructure.

2. The $0 Solution: PWIC Pilot

The initial six-month pilot phase is designed to prove the core concept of a transparent, redundant index using only existing datasets and in-kind (free) contributions from the open-source community and partner organizations.

Goal: Publish a machine-readable, triple-store index of 1 million highly-reliable .gov and .edu URLs for public adoption.
